# 4002ME Engineering Application Website

This is a simple website for the Motorsport Engineering module 4002ME project: a repeatable car powered purely by mechanical systems.

## 📂 Structure
- `index.html` — main webpage
- `style.css` — dark red motorsport-themed styling
- `script.js` — Three.js OBJ viewer
- `assets/` — images and sample 3D model

## ⚙️ To View the 3D Model
Replace `assets/sample_model.obj` with your own `.obj` file.  
Ensure the file path matches exactly in `script.js`.

## 🚀 Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Push all files to your GitHub repository (e.g. `4002ME-Engineering-Application`).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Click **Save** — your site will be live at:
   `https://your-username.github.io/4002ME-Engineering-Application/`

## 🏎️ Description
A mechanically powered, repeatable car that uses springs, gears, and flywheels to store and release energy efficiently without electricity.
